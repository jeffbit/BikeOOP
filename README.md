<h1 align=center> Kotlin Object Oriented Programming Project </h1>
<p>Small sample project written in Kotlin to showcase OOP design/concepts, Unit testing, and Test Driven Development.<p>

<h4>"Composition over inheritance" </h4>

<p>The Delegation Pattern was used throughout this project as it is natively supported in kotlin using the "by" keyword. The reason this was used is because one object can encapsulate a delegate object of another type and still use the functionality from the objects implmentation. The idea was to create reusable modular classes. The result is code that much easier to manage and maintain. </p>
